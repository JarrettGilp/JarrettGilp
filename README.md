### About Me ðŸ‘‹

Hello! I am Jarrett Gilpatric and I am an aspiring **Game Developer** as well as a **Computer Science and Engineering BS Student**.

The languages I am experienced with are **Java**, **C++**, **C#**, and **GML**. I'm always interested in broadening my knowledge of these languages as well as new ones that I'm able to get my hands on!

I have experience using **Unity** and **GameMakerStudio** for game development!

My passion is working on video games and being able to intrigue people with interesting, fun gameplay and riveting mechanics while giving them an experience that they'll remember for a long time.

I have participated in multiple Game Jams as a part of many teams. These games can be viewed and played on my [Itch.io profile](https://jarrettgilp.itch.io/). Check them out!

Outside of working, my hobbies include generally playing all of the games I can to broaden my views of the gaming world, as well as listening to tons of different music.

Some of my favorite games of all time are Resident Evil 2 (1998), Super Metroid, Resident Evil 4 (Both 2005 and 2023), Dark Souls, Hollow Knight, Final Fantasy VII, Chrono Trigger, and Devil May Cry 3.
