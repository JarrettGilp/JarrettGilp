### About Me 👋

⚡ Hello! I am Jarrett Gilpatric and I am an aspiring **Game Developer** as well as a **Computer Science BS Student**.

💻 The languages I am most experienced with are **C++** and **Java**. I'm always interested in broadening my knowledge of these languages as well as new ones that I'm able to get my hands on!

👾 I have experience using **Unity** for game development!

⚙️ My passion is working on video games and being able to intrigue people with interesting, fun gameplay and riveting mechanics while giving them an experience that they'll remember for a long time.

👥 I have participated in multiple Game Jams as a part of many teams. These games can be viewed and played on my [Itch.io profile](https://jarrettgilp.itch.io/). Check them out!

🕹️ Outside of working, my hobbies include generally playing all of the games I can to broaden my views of the gaming world, as well as listening to tons of different music.

🎮 Some of my favorite games of all time are Resident Evil 2 (1998), Super Metroid, Resident Evil 4 (Both 2005 and 2023), Dark Souls, Hollow Knight, Final Fantasy VII, Chrono Trigger, and Devil May Cry 3.
